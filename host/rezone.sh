# Description   : Host sided script that can change the timezone on your reMarkable
#                 according to the host or a specified timezone.

# Dependencies  : ssh, nc

# Notations     : I started reading a book about the regex language (Mastering Regular Expressions by Jeffrey E.F. Friedl).
#                 How did I manage to come this far in life without regular expressions!!!

# Current version (MAJOR.MINOR)
VERSION="1.0"
